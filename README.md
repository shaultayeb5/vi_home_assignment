# Member Churn Prediction & Outreach Prioritization

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to identify and prioritize members who are at the highest risk of churn. 
The goal is to enable targeted outreach that maximizes retention while minimizing cost. 
It includes feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and final recommendation of a ranked list of members to contact.

You should have the following files and update their paths inside the code:
● web_visits.csv
● app_usage.csv
● claims.csv
● churn_labels.csv
